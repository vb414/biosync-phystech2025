# BioSync - Real-Time Nutrition Optimization System

🏆 PhysTech 2025 Hackathon Project

## 🎯 Overview
BioSync is an AI-powered real-time nutrition optimization system that monitors multiple biometric markers during exercise and provides precise, personalized nutrition recommendations to prevent performance decline and health issues.

## 💡 Problem Statement
- 17,000+ athletes suffer heat-related injuries annually
- 2% dehydration causes 20% performance decline
- Current solutions use generic, one-size-fits-all approaches
- Athletes don't know what nutrients they need until it's too late

## 🔬 Solution
BioSync uses AI to:
- Monitor real-time biometrics (heart rate, hydration, electrolytes, glycogen)
- Predict nutritional needs BEFORE problems occur
- Provide precise recommendations ("drink 180ml with 0.3g sodium NOW")
- Adapt to individual physiology and exercise type

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Biometric Simulation**: Scientific models based on sports medicine research
- **AI Engine**: Real-time recommendation system with predictive algorithms
- **Visualization**: Recharts for real-time data display

## 📊 Key Features
1. **Real-Time Biometric Tracking**
   - Heart rate zones
   - Hydration levels
   - Electrolyte balance (Na+, K+, Mg2+)
   - Core temperature
   - Glycogen stores

2. **AI-Powered Recommendations**
   - Predictive hydration alerts
   - Electrolyte rebalancing
   - Energy replenishment timing
   - Temperature management

3. **Personalization**
   - Adapts to user profile
   - Exercise-specific algorithms
   - Environmental factor integration
